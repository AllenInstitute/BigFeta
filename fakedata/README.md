# creating a fake dataset
this isn't working well right now, please ignore
## 1. create a fake image
optional, but helpful for checking results in ndviz
## 2. create a perfect "pre-raw" stack
again, helpful for checking in ndviz. The final stack after alignment should match this one.
## 3. introduce transformations
this is the raw stack, equivalent to qhat wouldcome off the microscopes, after lens correction.
## 4. create point matches in overlaps
