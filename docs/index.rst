Welcome to EMaligner's documentation!
=====================================


EMaligner is a scalable linear least squares image stitching and alignment solver that can align millions of images via point correspondences. The solver runs on systems from individual workstations to distributed clusters.

This solver was developed to provide the image alignment steps for :cite:`mouse`. The starting point for this package was the MATLAB-based package described in :cite:`KDS`. This solver is described in :cite:`thiswork`.

Compared to that repository, this repository has a number of changes and additions:

.. |pastix| replace:: PaStiX
.. _pastix: https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/pastix
.. |petsc| replace:: PETSc
